# Poisson reduced-rank regression
## Overview
`poisson_rrr.py` contains the implementation of the Poisson reduced-rank regression (p-RRR) used in the manuscript [Global and local origins of trial-to-trial spike count variability in visual cortex](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.08.669442v1). `linear_rrr.py` contains the implementation of the [linear reduced-rank regression (RRR)](https://andrewcharlesjones.github.io/journal/reduced-rank-regression.html) which has been used to analyze [continuous neural data](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7893). `poissonrrr_demo.ipynb` compares the two models in a toy example with simulated spikes matrix. 

Briefly, p-RRR extends RRR to model discrete neural data, such as binned spike trains. It seeks to model the target neural population activities as a function of the other recorded variables (stimuli, facial behavior, activity of another neural population, etc), while enabling a shared structure on the dependence through its rank constraint. When its rank is not constrained, p-RRR is equivalent to fitting separate [Poisson GLMs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306650310) to each neuron in the target population individually. Similar to Poisson GLM, p-RRR also needs to be fitted using iterative numerical methods. We implemented p-RRR as a simple neural network in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and optimized it using the [limited-memory Broy-den–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.LBFGS.html).
